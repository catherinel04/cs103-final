        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h4>Hi, I'm Catherine</h4>
        <p>I am currently a junior at Boston University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics
            with a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Outside of the academic classroom, I love dance and reconnecting
            with parts of my culture. I have always loved listening to music in my free time, when I'm studying, and when
            I'm walking down the streets. I used to listen to a lot of JPOP back in 2020, but in the past few years I have
            transitioned into the world of Kpop!</p>

        <h3>Top Genre</h3>
        <p>My most listened to genre is kpop, or korean pop.</p>
        <p>Kpop is a popular music genre that originated in South Korea
            and is known for its style-bending, aesthetic-driven, and trendsetting sound.
            K-pop is characterized by its wide range of influences, including pop,
            hip-hop, R&B, electronic, and dance, as well as traditional Korean music. It
            is also known for its emphasis on dance choreography and overall stage prescence.</p>
